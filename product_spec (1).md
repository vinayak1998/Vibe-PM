# Product Spec: Airport Parking Booker

## Problem Statement
The uncertainty and scarcity of parking spots at airports is a significant problem for frequent business travelers and officials, who often have to rely on alternatives such as cabs, driving on their own, asking friends/family to drop, or carpooling.

## Target User Persona
Frequent business travelers or officials who value convenience, reliability, and transparency when booking parking spots near airports.

## MVP Features (Prioritized)

### P0 - Must Have
* Reliable and trustworthy parking spot booking within 1km radius of the airport
* Transparency about parking fees and rules for each spot

### P1 - Should Have
* Limited payment options for booking and paying for parking spots
* Advance booking or reserving parking spots

### P2 - Nice to Have
* User profiles and reviews of parking spots
* Integration with popular mapping services for directions to the parking spot

## Cut Features (with rationale)
The following features were cut from the MVP:
* Social features: not essential for the core problem and can be added later
* Analytics dashboards: not necessary for the MVP, and we can use third-party services for basic analytics
* Admin panels: not required for the initial launch, and we can manage the platform manually
* Carpooling and cab booking features: out of scope for the MVP, as the focus is on parking spot booking

## Core User Flow
Book a Parking Spot: a user searches for available parking spots near the airport, selects a spot, and completes the booking and payment process.

## Open Questions & Risks
* Success metric: TBD
* Revenue model: TBD
* Potential risks and challenges in integrating with licensed landowners or airport authorities

## Technical Considerations
Parking spots must be within 1km radius of the airport and owned by licensed landowners or airport authorities, which may require integration with external systems or APIs.
