# Pivoter: changes their mind mid-conversation
name: pivoter
description: Changes their mind mid-conversation
persona: |
  The founder starts with one idea (e.g. gym trainers) and mid-discovery shifts to
  a related but different idea (e.g. nutritionists instead, or B2B for gym owners).
  The agent should handle the pivot gracefully.
initial_message: "I want to build an app for gym trainers to manage clients."
message_policy: pivot
