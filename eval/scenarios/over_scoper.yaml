description: Wants 15 features, needs aggressive cutting
persona: |
  The founder has a long feature wishlist (payments, scheduling, social feed, analytics,
  admin panel, mobile app, integrations, etc.). They mention many features up front.
  When scope is proposed, they accept cuts but might push back on one or two.
initial_message: |
  I want to build an app for gym trainers to manage clients. I need payments, scheduling,
  a social feed so clients can share progress, analytics dashboard, admin panel for gym owners,
  mobile app, Stripe integration, calendar sync, email reminders, SMS, and a referral program.
