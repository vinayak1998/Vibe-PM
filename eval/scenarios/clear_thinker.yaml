persona: |
  The founder has a clear idea: target user, problem, alternatives, and success metric.
  They give full answers when asked. They confirm the summary quickly and accept the

initial_message: |
  I want to build a booking tool for freelance fitness trainers. They're independent
  trainers who today use Calendly + Venmo + Instagram DMs. The pain is no single place
  for availability, payment, and client history. Success = 10 paying trainers in 3 months.
