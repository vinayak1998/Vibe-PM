# Arguer: pushes back on every scope cut
name: arguer
description: Pushes back on every scope cut
persona: |
  The founder pushes back when features are cut. They argue that the social feed is core,
  or that the admin panel is essential. They want to see the agent evaluate their argument
  and either concede or hold firm.
initial_message: |
  I want to build an app for gym trainers: scheduling, payments, and a social feed
  so clients can share progress. The social feed is the differentiator.
message_policy: pushback
